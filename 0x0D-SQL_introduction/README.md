## Description
A SQL database, or Structured Query Language database, is a type of relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL as its primary interface for querying and manipulating data. SQL databases organize data into tables, which consist of rows and columns, following a tabular structure.

Key characteristics of SQL databases include:

1. **Structured Data**: SQL databases store data in a structured format, with predefined schemas that define the types and relationships of data stored in each table. This structured approach ensures data integrity and consistency.

2. **Relational Model**: SQL databases follow the relational model, which represents data as a collection of tables with defined relationships between them. These relationships are established through primary and foreign keys, enabling efficient data retrieval and manipulation.

3. **Query Language**: SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized language used to interact with SQL databases. SQL provides a set of commands and syntax for querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data from databases. It allows users to perform complex operations on data with ease.

4. **ACID Properties**: SQL databases typically adhere to the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, which ensure that database transactions are processed reliably and consistently. This ensures data integrity and protects against data loss or corruption.

5. **Scalability and Performance**: SQL databases offer scalability options to accommodate growing data volumes and user demands. They support features such as indexing, partitioning, and replication to improve performance and scalability.

6. **Security**: SQL databases provide robust security features to protect data from unauthorized access, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This includes user authentication, access control, encryption, and auditing mechanisms.
